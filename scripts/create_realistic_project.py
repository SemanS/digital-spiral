"""Create a realistic AI Support Copilot project in Jira with full history.

This script creates:
- Real team members (5-8 people)

- 150+ tickets with realistic workflow (To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done)
- Real conversations between team members
- Time-based progression (tickets created, worked on, completed over time)

Inspired by: Real SaaS product development (AI-powered support automation)
